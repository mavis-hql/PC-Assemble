### SUMMARY
<p>From this PC Assemble practical exercise, I have learned about what are the hardware that are in the tower units and how to assemble them. First of all, there are power supply, hard disks, RAM, fan, and other electronic components that make up the computer.  While we were dissembling the PC components, we faced problems such as being unable to unplug the cable and we were lucky that there were staff who could help us out and explain in detail the functions of each component to hone our understanding. We have also done a quiz after completing the PC Assemble session. 
It was the first group work that we had, our group is made up of 4 members, Kar Ying, Adam, Wei Yee, and me. It was a fun session with my group members. </p>
