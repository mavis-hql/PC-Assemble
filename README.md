SUMMARY <break>
From this PC Assemble practical exercise, I have learned about what are in the CPU casings and how to assemble them.First of all, there are power supply, hard disks, RAM, fan and other electronic components that made up the computer. We have also done a quiz after completing the PC Assemble. It was a fun session with my teammates.
